JavaScript Definitions

1. For Loop is a way to check for a condition many times. So, if something is
true, do something else. Then add something or subtract something, or multiply
or divide something to the condition. Repeat again until condition becomes
false.

2 &&, ||, ! are Boolean symbols for logic operations. && is the AND operator
and check the condition on the left for truth, and if true checks the condition
on the right for truth. If the 2 conditions are true the code block can be ran.
If one or the other are false, the code block will be skipped.

|| is the Boolean OR operator. It checks two or more conditions for truth and
if one is true, it executes the code block. If both are false is skips the code
block.

! is the NOT Boolean operator and will confuse you, I promise! It changes the
condition state to its opposite. So if something test true, the ! will switch it
to false and vice a verse.

3. Arrays are a way to group a list of objects into one variable memory space.
Example: `var luckyNumbers = [22, 44, 88, 176];` Use [] to indicate that the
object is an Array.

4. Git is software that you  install on your computer to manage files in a
project folder called a Repo or Repository. It is used to collaborate with other
programmers who are working together on the project. Everyone can have their own
version, working on their specific section.

5. GitHub is a service for uploading, downloading, and collaborating on projects
online. It will store the Repo and if you have permissions, you can Fork into
a project and clone it to your local computer. You can upload changes and ask for
them to be Merged with the project through a Pull Request.
